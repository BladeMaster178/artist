  <h2 class="text"><em>Siarhei Trukhan Biography</em></h2>
  <img src="1462.jpg" alt="" width="40%" height="" class="leftimg">
  <p>
    <em>
    Sergei Trukhan was born in Minsk, Russia in 1970 and demonstrated his artistic gift
    at a very young age. He constantly held pencils, paints or camera in hand to capture
    all creative expression. When he enrolled in the Army, he discovered other artists with
    whom he would later serve as apprentice. They shared his intense passion for painting.
    And, because he is responsible for developing his own artistic skills, Sergei considers himself
    to be self-taught.

    When beauty and light are found in the details of nature, Sergei has the ability to capture
    the essence of light with exquisite wonder. The harmony he achieves in his paintings brings
    life to any lyrical, traditional or contemporary landscape. With a profound vision and love for
    nature, he paints what we perceive--and so much more. Scholars have come to recognize this
    style as "Hypo Realism", where detail and technical skills come together and are brilliantly
    demonstrated.

    Sergei strongly emphasizes the penetration of light into darkness as a "luminescent" style.
    Thus, his hope is that appreciation for his art will create gratitude for nature and our surroundings,
    and will spawn an awe-inspiring awakening for simple yet complex artistic expression. His creative
    artistry reveals the artist’s unique outlook: sunlit and full of life with a spiritual concordance with
    Nature and the Land--all of which captures light in unusual ways. Sergei contemplates and then
    delivers the multi-faceted world in which he feels interconnected.

    Sergei currently resides in Belarus, Russia with his wife and two sons. His popularity as an artist
    has quickly reached international acclaim as his technique, talent and eye for the unique and unusual
    scene has achieved the rank of Master Artist.
